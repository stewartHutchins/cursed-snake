# Gyroscopic Phone Controller
This is (somehow) an android app for gyroscopic control
of our crappy snake game. This works in theory.

This ONLY works if you FACE towards the glass in the other
Bedford lab. This could be fixed if I cared about it.

It works 100% of the time if you face the right way.
